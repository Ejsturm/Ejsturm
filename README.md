- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ejsturm (call me Erica or Ej--"ee-jay" like the letters)
- 👀 I’m interested in electronic strucutre and quantum mechanics, specifically in the gas phase (quantum chemistry).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about quantum computing techniques and machine learning techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quantum computing ideas, specifically for chemistry applications. Side interests include how to use linear algebra and/or machine learning techniques to overcomethe high computational costs that come with accurately modelling quantum systems. 
- 📫 You may reach me at sturm.ericaj@gmail.com.
