- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ejsturm (call me Ej--"eee-jay" like the letters)
- 👀 I’m interested in electronic strucutre and quantum mechanics, specifically in the gas phase (quantum chemistry).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to use linear algebra and/or machine learning techniques to overcomethe high computational costs that come with accurately modelling quantum systems. 
- 📫 How to reach me....
